## Notes
 While building this app, I encountered some challenges locating the right logcat statements and using the filters correctly. Through much perserverence and experimenting,
 I've figured out how to do it correctly!
 Thank you Codepath for another fun and challenging pre-work assignment. I am so excited for the AND 102 semester.
